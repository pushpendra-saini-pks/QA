In this work, we\\npropose a novel adaptive QA framework that\\ncan dynamically select the most suitable strat-\\negy for (retrieval-augmented) LLMs from the\\nsimplest to the most sophisticated ones based\\non the query complexity. Also, this selec-\\ntion process is operationalized with a classi-\\nfier, which is a smaller LM trained to predict\\nthe complexity level of incoming queries with\\nautomatically collected labels, obtained from\\nactual predicted outcomes of models and in-\\nherent inductive biases in datasets.

However, they still generate factu-\\nally incorrect answers since their knowledge solely\\nrelies on their parametric memory (Kasai et al.,\\n2022; Mallen et al., 2023). Meanwhile, memoriz-\\ning all the (ever-changing) world knowledge may\\nnot be possible. To address this problem, retrieval-\\naugmented LLMs (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard\\net al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), which incorporate\\nnon-parametric knowledge into LLMs with addi-\\ntional retrieval modules, have gained much increas-\\ning attention. Specifically, these models access\\na knowledge base, which serves as an extensive\\nrepository of information across various subjects\\nand disciplines, to retrieve information relevant to\\nthe given input, and then incorporate the retrieved\\ninformation into LLMs, which enables them to stay\\naccurate and current with the world knowledge.\\nA particularly salient application of retrieval-\\naugmented LLMs is to handling QA tasks, whose\\ngoal is to provide correct answers in response to\\nuser queries, especially those of high complexity.\\nEarly work on retrieval-augmented LLMs focuses\\nprimarily on single-hop queries (Lazaridou et al.,\\n2022; Ram et al., 2023), whose answers are typ-\\nically found within a single document; therefore,\\nthis approach involves retrieving a relevant doc-\\nument based on the query and subsequently inte-\\ngrating this information into QA models to formu-\\nlate a response. However, unlike this single-hop\\nQA, some queries require connecting and aggregat-\\ning multiple documents, which are, furthermore,arXiv:2403.14403v2  [cs.CL]  28 Mar 2024'),\n",

An example query\\nis ‘When did the people who captured Malakoff\\ncome to the region where Philipsburg is located?’,\\nwhich requires four reasoning steps to solve. There-\\nfore, to effectively handle such complex queries,\\nrecent studies have concentrated largely on multi-\\nstep and multi-reasoning QA, which requires itera-\\ntive accesses to both LLMs and retrievers multiple\\ntimes (Press et al., 2023; Trivedi et al., 2023), at\\nthe cost of heavy computational overheads.\\nYet, we should rethink: In a real-world scenario,\\nare all the requests from users complex? Instead,\\nusers might often ask simple and straightforward\\nquestions, while only occasionally asking complex\\nones. Specifically, a query such as ‘Paris is the\\ncapital of what?’ is likely to be asked more fre-\\nquently, compared to the aforementioned multi-\\nstep query, and this simpler query might also be\\neasily answered by the LLMs themselves, without\\naccessing external knowledge. In other words, a\\nmulti-step QA approach could give rise to unnec-\\nessary computational overhead for simple queries,\\neven though it would be vital for complex queries\\n(see Figure 2 (A)). On the other hand, handling\\ncomplex queries with single-step-retrieval or even\\nnon-retrieval strategies would be largely insuffi-\\ncient (Figure 2 (B)). This suggests the need for an\\nadaptive QA system, which can dynamically adjust\\nthe operational strategies of retrieval-augmented\\nLLMs based on the query complexity. While some\\nrecent approaches are capable of doing this based\\non the frequency of entities in queries (Mallen et al.,\\n2023) or on the generated outputs from models\\nfor multi-step QA (Trivedi et al., 2023), they are\\nstill suboptimal: the former methods are overly\\nsimplistic, failing to consider multi-hop queries;\\nmeanwhile, the latter are excessively complex, ter-\\nminating answer solving steps after several rounds\\nof module access.In this work, considering diverse complexity lev-\\nels of real-world queries, we argue that previous\\none-size-fits-all approaches might be inadequate to\\ncover all of them. Instead, we propose to select the\\nmost suitable strategy from a range of (retrieval-\\naugmented) LLMs, each of which is tailored to the\\nspecific complexity of the input query. Notably,\\na critical step in this process is pre-defining the\\nquery complexity, which is instrumental in deter-\\nmining the most fitting model to it. In this work,\\nwe operationalize this process with a novel classi-\\nfier, which is a smaller model trained to predict the\\ncomplexity level of incoming queries (see Figure 2\\n(c)). Moreover, we automatically collect its training\\ndatasets without human labeling, by leveraging the\\npredicted outcomes (i.e., which models accurately\\nrespond to which queries) as well as by capitalizing\\non the inherent biases in existing datasets (i.e., sam-\\nples in the datasets are designed either for single-\\nstep or for multi-step QA scenarios). This proposed\\nmethod can offer a robust middle ground among the\\niterative LLM augmentation methods for complex\\nqueries, single-step methods for simpler queries,\\nand even no-retrieval-augmented methods for the\\nmost straightforward queries (answerable by LLMs\\nthemselves), thus significantly enhancing the over-\\nall efficiency and accuracy, as shown in Figure 1.\\nWe refer to our framework as Adaptive Retrieval-\\nAugmented Generation (Adaptive-RAG).\\nWe validate Adaptive-RAG using benchmark\\nopen-domain QA datasets, covering a wide range\\nof query complexity from single-hop (Rajpurkar\\net al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al.,\\n2019) to multi-hop (Yang et al., 2018; Ho et al.,\\n2020; Trivedi et al., 2022b) queries.

Along\\nwith the emergence of LLMs with superior rea-\\nsoning capabilities thanks to their billion-sized pa-\\nrameters (Wei et al., 2022a), a synergy between\\nLLMs and retrievers has led to significant advance-\\nments (Lazaridou et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023).\\nSpecifically, this integration has been shown to\\nenhance Open-domain QA by mitigating the hallu-\\ncination problem from LLMs through strengthened\\nreasoning abilities of the reader, as well as utiliz-\\ning the retrieved, external documents (Cho et al.,\\n2023). Despite these advancements for single-hop\\nretrieval-augmented LLMs, however, the complex-\\nity of some queries needs a more complex strategy.\\nMulti-hop QA Multi-hop QA is an extension of\\nconventional Open-domain QA, which addition-\\nally requires the system to comprehensively gather\\nand contextualize information from multiple docu-\\nments (often iteratively), to answer more complex\\nqueries (Trivedi et al., 2022a; Yang et al., 2018). In\\nthe realm of multi-hop QA, the approach to itera-\\ntively access both LLMs and the retrieval module\\nis generally employed. Specifically, Khattab et al.\\n(2022), Press et al. (2023), Pereira et al. (2023)\\nand Khot et al. (2023) proposed to first decom-\\npose the multi-hop queries into simpler single-hop\\nqueries, repeatedly access the LLMs and retriever\\nto solve these sub-queries, and merge their solu-\\ntions to formulate a complete answer. In contrastto this decomposition-based approach, other re-\\ncent studies, such as Yao et al. (2023) and Trivedi\\net al. (2023), explored the interleaving of Chain-of-\\nThought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b) — a method\\nwhere a logical sequence of thoughts is generated\\n— with document retrieval, repeatedly applying this\\nprocess until the reasoning chain generates the an-\\nswer. In addition, Jiang et al. (2023) introduced an\\napproach to repeatedly retrieving new documents\\nif the tokens within generated sentences have low\\nconfidence. However, the aforementioned methods\\noverlooked the fact that, in real-world scenarios,\\nqueries are of a wide variety of complexities. There-\\nfore, it would be largely inefficient to iteratively\\naccess LLMs and retrievers for every query, which\\nmight be simple enough with a single retrieval step\\nor even only with an LLM itself.\\nAdaptive Retrieval To handle queries of varying\\ncomplexities, the adaptive retrieval strategy aims to\\ndynamically decide whether to retrieve documents\\nor not, based on each query’s complexity. In this\\nvein, Mallen et al. (2023) proposed to decide the\\nquery’s complexity level based on the frequency of\\nits entities and suggested using the retrieval mod-\\nules only when the frequency falls below a cer-\\ntain threshold. However, this approach, focusing\\nsolely on the binary decision of whether to retrieve\\nor not, may not be sufficient for more complex\\nqueries that require multiple reasoning steps. Ad-\\nditionally, Qi et al. (2021) proposed an approach\\nthat performs a fixed set of operations (retrieving,\\nreading, and reranking) multiple times until the an-\\nswer is derived for the given query, which is built\\nupon traditional BERT-like LMs. However, unlike\\nour Adaptive-RAG which pre-determines the query\\ncomplexity and adapts the operational behavior of\\nany off-the-shelf LLMs accordingly, this approach\\napplies the same fixed operations to every query\\nregardless of its complexity but also necessitates\\nadditional specific training to LMs. Concurrent to\\nour work, Asai et al. (2024) suggested training a so-\\nphisticated model to dynamically retrieve, critique,\\nand generate the text. Nevertheless, we argue that\\nall the aforementioned adaptive retrieval methods\\nthat rely on a single model might be suboptimal in\\nhandling a variety of queries of a range of differ-\\nent complexities since they tend to be either overly\\nsimple or complex for all the input queries, which\\ndemands a new approach that can select the most\\nsuitable strategy of retrieval-augmented LLMs tai-\\nlored to the query complexity.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:/Q A/document/RAG.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='3 Method\\nIn this section, we describe our approach to adapt-\\ning retrieval-augmented LLMs, by pre-determining\\nthe query complexity and then selecting the most\\nfitting strategies for retrieval-augmented LLMs.\\n3.1 Preliminaries\\nWe begin with preliminaries, formally introducing\\ndifferent strategies of retrieval-augmented LLMs.\\nNon Retrieval for QA Let us first define an LLM\\nas a model LLM, which takes a sequence of tokens\\nx= [x1, x2, ..., x n]as an input and then generates\\na sequence of tokens y= [y1, y2, ..., y n]as an out-\\nput, which is formalized as follows: y=LLM(x).\\nThen, in our problem setup for QA, xandybe-\\ncome the input query ( q) from the user and the\\ngenerated answer ( ¯a) from the LLM, respectively:\\nq=xand¯a=y. Also, subsequently, the most\\nnaïve LLM-powered QA model can be represented\\nas follows: ¯a=LLM(q). Ideally, ¯ashould match\\nthe actual correct answer a. This non-retrieval-\\nbased QA method is highly efficient and could be\\na somewhat promising approach to handling easy\\nqueries, as the size of LLMs becomes extremely\\nlarge with its effect on storing a large amount of\\nknowledge. However, this approach is largely prob-\\nlematic on queries that require precise or concur-\\nrent knowledge of specific people, events, or any\\nsubjects beyond the LLMs’ internal knowledge.\\nSingle-step Approach for QA To address the\\naforementioned scenarios where LLMmay struggle\\nwith queries that are not answerable by LLMitself,\\nwe can utilize the external knowledge d, which\\nincludes useful information for queries, retrieved\\nfrom the external knowledge source Dthat could\\nbe an encyclopedia (e.g., Wikipedia) consisting\\nof millions of documents. Specifically, to obtain\\nsuchdfromD, a specific retrieval model is nec-\\nessary, which returns documents based on their\\nrelevance with the given query. This process can\\nbe formulated as follows: d=Retriever (q;D),\\nwhere Retriever is the retrieval model, with\\nd∈ D . Here, we can use any off-the-shelf re-\\ntriever (Robertson et al., 1994; Karpukhin et al.,\\n2020).\\nAfter the retrieval step is done, we now have a\\npair of query qand its relevant documents d. Then,\\nin order to augment LLMs with this retrieved exter-\\nnal knowledge, we can incorporate it into the input\\nof LLMs, represented as follows: ¯a=LLM(q,d).This process allows LLMs to gain access to exter-\\nnal information contained in d, which can provide\\nthe supplementary context that the internal knowl-\\nedge of LLMlacks, which can subsequently improve\\nthe accuracy and concurrency of LLMs for QA.\\nMulti-step Approach for QA Even though the\\naforementioned single-step approach offers signif-\\nicant improvements over non-retrieval for qthat\\nrequires external knowledge, it encounters notable\\nlimitations, particularly when dealing with com-\\nplex queries that necessitate synthesizing informa-\\ntion from multiple source documents and reasoning\\nover them. This is where a multi-step approach and\\nreasoning for QA become essential.\\nIn this multi-step approach, LLMinteracts with\\nRetriever in several rounds, progressively refin-\\ning its understanding of q, until it formulates the fi-\\nnal answer from findings accumulated across these\\nmultiple steps. Specifically, the process begins\\nwith the initial query q, and at every retrieval step\\ni, new documents diare retrieved from Dand then\\nincorporated into the input of LLMs, as follows:\\n¯ai=LLM(q,di,ci), where the additional context\\ncican be composed of previous documents and\\noutcomes (d1,d2, ...,di−1,¯a1,¯a2, ...,¯ai−1), and\\ndi=Retriever (q,ci;D)1. We would like to\\nnote that this iterative, multi-step process enables\\nLLMto construct a more comprehensive and exten-\\nsive foundation to solve queries effectively, specif-\\nically adept at complex multi-hop queries where\\nanswers depend on interconnected pieces of infor-\\nmation. However, it is important to recognize that\\nthis multi-step approach can be resource-intensive\\ndue to the repeated accesses to Retriever andLLM,\\nwhich entail substantial computational costs.\\n3.2 Adaptive-RAG: Adaptive\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\\nWe now introduce our adaptive retrieval-augmented\\nLLMs, which are built upon three different strate-\\ngies described in the previous section, and which\\nare designed to select the most suitable strategy\\naccording to the complexity of queries.\\nAdapting Retrieval-Augmented LLMs Note\\nthat in real-world scenarios, not all qfrom users\\nhave the same level of complexity, necessitating\\n1It is worth noting that implementations of the LLM and\\nretriever vary across different multi-step retrieval-augmented\\nLLM approaches (Trivedi et al., 2023; Press et al., 2023; Yao\\net al., 2023); therefore, the context cimay incorporate none,\\nsome, or all of the previous documents and answers.'),\n",

In other\\nwords, employing the most basic, non-retrieval-\\nbased approach LLM(q)to respond to the complex\\nquery qwould be also ineffective (Figure 2, A);\\nconversely, using a more elaborate multi-step ap-\\nproach LLM(q,d,c)for simple qwould be ineffi-\\ncient (Figure 2, B). Therefore, our adaptive frame-\\nwork is designed to dynamically adjust the query-\\nhandling strategy of retrieval-augmented LLMs,\\nwhich is achieved by determining the complexity of\\neach query before attempting a solution.

In\\nparticular, for effectiveness, we use F1, EM, and\\nAccuracy (Acc), following the standard evaluation\\nprotocol (Mallen et al., 2023; Baek et al., 2023;\\nAsai et al., 2024), where F1 measures the number\\nof overlapping words between the predicted an-\\nswer and the ground truth, EM measures whether\\nthey are the same, and Acc measures whether the\\npredicted answer contains the ground-truth answer.\\nFor efficiency, we measure the number of retrieval-\\nand-generate steps and the average time for answer-\\ning each query relative to the one-step approach.\\n4.4 Implementation Details\\nFor a fair comparison and following Mallen et al.\\n(2023) and Trivedi et al. (2023), we use the same re-\\ntriever, a term-based sparse retrieval model known\\nas BM25 (Robertson et al., 1994), across all differ-\\nent models.

In\\naddition, we report the more granular results with\\nFLAN-T5-XL on each of the single-hop and multi-\\nhop datasets in Table 2 (and more with different\\nLLMs in Table 7 and Table 8 of Appendix), which\\nare consistent with the results observed in Table 1.\\nHowever, in a real-world scenario, not all users\\nask queries with the same level of complexity,\\nwhich emphasizes the importance of the need for\\nadaptive strategies. Note that among the adaptive\\nstrategies, our Adaptive-RAG shows remarkableeffectiveness over the competitors (Table 1). This\\nindicates that merely focusing on the decision of\\nwhether to retrieve or not is suboptimal. Also, as\\nshown in Table 2, such simple adaptive strategies\\nare particularly inadequate for handling complex\\nqueries in multi-hop datasets, which require ag-\\ngregated information and reasoning over multiple\\ndocuments. Meanwhile, our approach can consider\\na more fine-grained query handling strategy by fur-\\nther incorporating an iterative module for complex\\nqueries. Furthermore, in a realistic setting, we\\nshould take into account not only effectiveness but\\nalso efficiency. As shown in Table 1, compared to\\nthe complex multi-step strategy, our proposed adap-\\ntive strategy is significantly more efficient across\\nall model sizes. This is meaningful in this era of\\nLLMs, where the cost of accessing them is a critical\\nfactor for practical applications and scalability. Fi-\\nnally, to see the upper bound of our Adaptive-RAG,\\nwe report its performances with the oracle classifier\\nwhere the classification performance is perfect. As\\nshown in Table 1 and Table 2, we observe that it\\nachieves the best performance while being much\\nmore efficient than our Adaptive-RAG without the\\noracle classifier. These results support the valid-\\nity and significance of our proposal for adapting\\nretrieval-augmented LLM strategies based on query\\ncomplexity, and further suggest the direction to de-\\nvelop more improved classifiers to achieve optimal\\nperformance.'),\n",

Specifically, Adaptive-RAG is de-\\nsigned to dynamically adjust its query handling\\nstrategies in the unified retrieval-augmented LLM\\nbased on the complexity of queries that they en-\\ncounter, which spans across a spectrum of the non-\\nretrieval-based approach for the most straightfor-\\nward queries, to the single-step approach for the\\nqueries of moderate complexity, and finally to the\\nmulti-step approach for the complex queries. The\\ncore step of our Adaptive-RAG lies in determin-\\ning the complexity of the given query, which is\\ninstrumental in selecting the most suitable strat-\\negy for its answer. To operationalize this process,\\nwe trained a smaller Language Model with query-\\ncomplexity pairs, which are automatically anno-\\ntated from the predicted outcomes and the inductive\\nbiases in datasets. We validated our Adaptive-RAGon a collection of open-domain QA datasets, cover-\\ning the multiple query complexities including both\\nthe single- and multi-hop questions. The results\\ndemonstrate that our Adaptive-RAG enhances the\\noverall accuracy and efficiency of QA systems, al-\\nlocating more resources to handle complex queries\\nwhile efficiently handling simpler queries, com-\\npared to the existing one-size-fits-all approaches\\nthat tend to be either minimalist or maximalist over\\nvarying query complexities.\\nLimitations\\nWhile our Adaptive-RAG shows clear advantages\\nin effectiveness and efficiency by determining the\\nquery complexity and then leveraging the most\\nsuitable approach for tackling it, it is important\\nto recognize that there still exist potential avenues\\nfor improving the classifier from the perspectives\\nof its training datasets and architecture. Specifi-\\ncally, as there are no available datasets for training\\nthe query-complexity classifier, we automatically\\ncreate new data based on the model prediction out-\\ncomes and the inductive dataset biases. However,\\nour labeling process is one specific instantiation\\nof labeling the query complexity, and it may have\\nthe potential to label queries incorrectly despite its\\neffectiveness. Therefore, future work may create\\nnew datasets that are annotated with a diverse range\\nof query complexities, in addition to the labels of\\nquestion-answer pairs. Also, as the performance\\ngap between the ideal classifier in Table 1 and the\\ncurrent classifier in Figure 3 indicates, there is still\\nroom to improve the effectiveness of the classifier.\\nIn other words, our classifier design based on the\\nsmaller LM is the initial, simplest instantiation for\\nclassifying the query complexity, and based upon\\nit, future work may improve the classifier archi-\\ntecture and its performance, which will positively\\ncontribute to the overall QA performance.'),\n",

We\\nuse the FLAN-T5-XL (3B) as the base LLM.\\nA Additional Experimental Setups\\nA.1 Datasets\\nWe use publicly open datasets for both single-\\nhop and multi-hop QA datasets, referring to\\nas Karpukhin et al. (2020) and Trivedi et al. (2023),\\nrespectively. We describe the characteristics of\\neach dataset:\\n1) SQuAD v1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is created\\nthrough a process where annotators write questions\\nbased on the documents they read.\\n2) Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) is\\nconstructed by real user queries on Google Search.\\n3) TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) comprises trivia\\nquestions sourced from various quiz websites.\\n4) MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022a) is collected by\\ncompositing multiple single-hop queries, to form\\nqueries spanning 2-4 hops.\\n5) HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) is constructed by\\nhaving annotators create questions that link multi-\\nple Wikipedia articles.\\n6) 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020) is derived\\nfrom Wikipedia and its associated knowledge graph\\npath, needing 2-hops.\\nA.2 Models\\nWe describe the details of models as follows:\\n1) No Retrieval. This approach uses only the LLM\\nitself, to generate the answer to the given query.\\n2) Single-step Approach. This approach first re-\\ntrieves the relevant knowledge with the given query\\nfrom the external knowledge sources and then aug-\\nments the LLM with this retrieved knowledge to\\ngenerate the answer, which iterates only once.\\n3) Adaptive Retrieval. This baseline (Mallen et al.,\\n2023) adaptively augments the LLM with the re-\\ntrieval module, only when the entities appearing\\nin queries are less popular. To extract entities, we\\nuse the available entity-linking method (Li et al.,\\n2020), namely BLINK, for questions.\\n4) Self-RAG. This baseline (Asai et al., 2024)\\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0\\nTime per Query304050Performance (F1)  No Retrieval  Single-step Approach\\n  Adaptive Retrieval  Multi-step Approach  Adaptive-RAG (Ours)Performance vs Time with FLAN-T5-XXLFigure 5: QA performance (F1) and efficiency (Time/Query)\\nfor different retrieval-augmented generation approaches. We\\nuse the FLAN-T5-XXL (11B) as the base LLM.\\ntrains the LLM to adaptively perform retrieval and\\ngeneration, where the retrieval is conducted once it\\npredicts the special retrieval token above a certain\\nthreshold, and the answer generation follows.\\n5) Adaptive-RAG. This is our model that adap-\\ntively selects the retrieval-augmented generation\\nstrategy, smoothly oscillating between the non-\\nretrieval, single-step approach, and multi-step ap-\\nproaches4without architectural changes, based on\\nthe query complexity assessed by the classifier.\\n6) Multi-step Approach. This approach (Trivedi\\net al., 2023) is the multi-step retrieval-augmented\\nLLM, which iteratively accesses both the retriever\\nand LLM with interleaved Chain-of-Thought rea-\\nsoning (Wei et al., 2022b) repeatedly until it derives\\nthe solution or reaches the maximum step number.\\n7) Adaptive-RAG w/ Oracle This is an ideal sce-\\nnario of our Adaptive-RAG equipped with an or-\\nacle classifier that perfectly categorizes the query\\ncomplexity.\\nA.3 Implementation Details\\nFor computing resources, we use A100 GPUs\\nwith 80GB memory. In addition, due to the sig-\\nnificant costs associated with evaluating retrieval-\\naugmented generation models, we perform experi-\\nments with a single run. Finally, we implemented\\nmodels using PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and\\nTransformers library (Wolf et al., 2020).\\nB Additional Experimental Results\\nPerformance vs Time We further provide a com-\\nparison of different retrieval-augmented genera-\\ntion approaches with FLAN-T5-XL and FLAN-T5-\\nXXL models in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively,\\nin the context of performance and efficiency trade-\\noffs.

This could involve using techniques like keyword search, semantic search, or passage retrieval.\\n\\n2. **Language Model:** The retrieved information is then fed into a language model (LM), such as GPT-3 or BERT. The LM uses its knowledge of language and its ability to generate text to create a coherent and informative answer based on the retrieved information.\\n\\nIn essence, RAG aims to bridge the gap between the vast information available in the world and the ability of language models to generate human-like text.

It may ask for additional information or rephrase the query.\\n4. **Iterative Process:**  The LLM repeats steps 2 and 3, iteratively refining its understanding and retrieving more relevant information.\\n5. **Final Answer:**  After multiple rounds, the LLM has accumulated enough information to formulate a final answer to the complex question.\\n\\n**Why is it useful?**\\n\\n* **Complex Questions:** Multi-step QA is particularly useful for complex questions that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and reasoning over them.\\n* **Progressive Understanding:** It allows the LLM to gradually build its understanding of the question, which is essential for complex tasks. \\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nImagine you ask a question like \"What were the main causes of the decline of the Roman Empire?\" A multi-step QA approach might involve:\\n\\n1. **Initial Retrieval:** The LLM retrieves documents about the Roman Empire.\\n2. **Refinement:**  The LLM realizes it needs more specific information about the decline and asks for documents about economic factors.\\n3. **Further Retrieval:** The LLM retrieves documents about Roman economic problems.\\n4. **Final Answer:** Based on the information gathered, the LLM can formulate a comprehensive answer about the decline of the Roman Empire, incorporating multiple factors. \\n'"
